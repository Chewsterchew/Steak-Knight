Thanks for looking at my bot!
Let me show you around.

# Dependencies

You've got a few of these bad boys to install via npm or your preferred package manager.
Eris, fs, snekfetch (soon to be replaced), pg

# What is this help me

This is a Discord bot (which I'm sure you know, but you gotta be positive) written in Javascript that uses the Eris library.
The other popular library is Discord.js, which I personally don't like, but whatever floats your boat.

# HOW MAKE IT SPEAK WORD

Woah there! If you want to try to get up and running as soon as possible, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed (either version is fine)
2.  Make sure [Git]() is installed (to clone the repo)
3.  In terms of dependencies, only install Eris and fs if you want to go fast
4.  Git clone the repository
5.  comment out any lines relating to postgres or snekfetch
6.  node app.js
7.  good job
